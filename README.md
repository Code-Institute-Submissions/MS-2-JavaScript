## ***Introduction***

**Single-player reaction time game** 

This is my second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements is to write custom front-end interactive web application, using HTML, CSS and Javascript, JavaScript libraries and/or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

The application I'm writing for this project is single-player reaction time game, written mostly in JavaScript.<br> 
The objective of the game is to click or tap the objects that are spawning randomly on the screen as quickly as you can.<br>
In order to keep the game challenging, complexity will increase over the course of the game.

### **Deploying on GitHub Pages**
1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
1. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/)"Link to GitHub Repo".
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
1. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
1. Upon selection, the page will automatically refresh meaning that the website is now deployed.
1. Under "GitHub Pages", select the GitHub Pages visibility drop-down menu, then click a visibility.
1. Now deploy it to GitHub Pages.
1. To see your published site, under "GitHub Pages", click your site's URL.

More Detailed information on GitHub Pages can be found here: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) "Link to GitHub docs"
### **Fork A repository**
A Fork is a coppy of repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without effecting the original project.
<br>Forking a repository is a simple two-step process.

1. On GitHub, navigate to The [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/)" Link to my Repo".
1. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

Detailed Steps for forkig a repository from GitHub can be found here: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
### **Creating a Clone**
You can clone reposetory. When you clone repository, you copy repository to your Machine.
<br>Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Raivis80/)"Link to GitHub Repo".
<br>Steps for cloning a repository from GitHub can be found here: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) "Link to GitHub docs"
