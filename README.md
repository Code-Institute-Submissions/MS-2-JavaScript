## ***Introduction***

**Single-player reaction time game** 

This is my second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements is to write custom front-end interactive web application, using HTML, CSS and Javascript, JavaScript libraries and/or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

In order to manipulate the DOM as much as posible, I'm building a simple JavaScript single-player reaction time game.<br> 
The objective of the game is to click or tap the objects that are spawning randomly on the screen as quickly as you can.<br>
To keep the game challenging, complexity will increase over the course of the game.

- Typography
    - Primary font-family: Press Start 2P with cursive as a fallback font
    - Secondary font-family: Roboto witn sans-serif as a fallback
### **Wireframe**

## **Game Mechanics**
1. Game Play
    - Select dificulty level to start the game.
    - Click or tap on target objects once they spawn.
1. Select Level 
    - Touch enabled devices staart with higher speed.
    - Levels for mobile devices  = "Easy" Start with one target, "Medium" start with two targets "Hard" start with three targets.
    - Levels for PC's devices  = "Easy" Start with two targets, "Medium" start with three targets "Hard" start with four targets.
1. Score Counters
    - Score counter:
        - Will increase by 1, once player clicks on the target.
    - Missed score counter:
        - Will increase by 1 if target is not clicked on time or target is missed altogether.
1. Lives Remaining
    - The game starts with three lives.
    - Players will gain life once every 50 score points. 
    - Maximum three lives can be gained at once.
    - Player will lose life if target is not clicked on time or target is missed altogether. 
    - Losing all lives means "game over".
# [&#8686;](#Top)
## **Game Logic**  
![View](project_files/wireframe2.jpg)

- Select Level
    - Added touchscreen detection, for mobile devices starting speed is faster than pointing enabled devices.
    - Levels for mobile devices  = "Easy" Start with one target, "Medium" start with two targets "Hard" start with three targets.
    - Levels for PC's devices  = "Easy" Start with two targets, "Medium" start with three targets "Hard" start with four targets.
- Lives Remaining
    - Based on capture and click events, all Unsuccessful clicks and missed on time events will disable one life element.
    - Based on Score counter, every 50 score points will create one life. Enable one life element (if statement).
    or miss click the box on time 
- Random Number generator
    - Extract Window height and width.
    - Create random number integer of a current window width and height.
- In game target objects
    - Target HTML div elements in the DOM for game box targets.
    - Two random generated integers used for position x and y coardinates to target css position properties for HTML div elements.
- Click event listeners and capture events.
    - Create event listeners for game targets that will record successfull clicks and disable target once clicked.
    - Create event listener for game window to record unsuccessful clicks.
    - Capture events on all failed click attempts. I managed to acheave this by counting how many objects at the end of setInterval() cycle has display: none; 
- Game setup
    - Based on Level selection. if "EASY", else if "MEDIUM", else if "HARD".
    - Level variable will be passed into setInterval() function and will launch the game.
- Game Proggression levels
    - Speed will increase over course of the game. 
    - Target count will increase over course of the game.
    - Create setInterval() function pass it into game level sellection once desired score is reached.
