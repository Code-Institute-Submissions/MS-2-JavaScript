## ***Introduction***

**Single-player reaction time game** 

This is my second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirement for this project is to write interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

To manipulate the DOM as much as possible, I'm building a simple JavaScript single-player reaction time game.<br> 
The objective of this game is to click or tap the objects that are spawning randomly on the screen as quickly as you can.<br>
The difficulty will increase throughout the game.

### **Wireframe**

You can view the wireframe [Here](project_files/wireframe.jpg)

# [&#8686;](#Top)
## **Game Mechanics**
1. Game Play
    - Select a difficulty level to start the game.
    - Click or tap on target objects once they spawn.
1. Select Level 
    - Touch-enabled devices start with higher speed.
    - Levels for mobile devices  = "Easy" Start with one target, "Medium" start with two targets "Hard" start with three targets.
    - Levels for PC's devices  = "Easy" Start with two targets, "Medium" start with three targets "Hard" start with four targets.
1. Score Counters
    - Score counter:
        - Will increase by one once the player clicks on the target.
    - Missed score counter:
        - Will increase by one if the target is not clicked on time or target is, missed altogether.
1. Lives Remaining
    - The game starts with three lives.
    - Players will gain life once every 50 score points. 
    - Maximum of three lives can be gained at once.
    - Player will lose a life if the target is not clicked on time or the target is missed altogether. 
    - Losing all lives means game over.
# [&#8686;](#Top)
## **Game Logic**  

Game logic wireframe can be seen [Here](project_files/wireframe2.jpg)
*** 
- Select Level
    - Added touchscreen detection, for mobile devices starting speed is faster than pointing enabled devices.
    - Levels for mobile devices  = "Easy" Start with one target, "Medium" start with two targets "Hard" start with three targets.
    - Levels for PC's devices  = "Easy" Start with two targets, "Medium" start with three targets "Hard" start with four targets.
        - Level target count and speed could be set in the game.js file 

Detect touch devices & add one ectra target for touch enebled devices & and set speed 
```JavaScript 
if ('ontouchstart' in window) { //<-Detect Touch devices
         speed = 2800; // <-Set game starting speed and everything else will change dynamically
        for (cube of cubes) {//<-IIf Touchscreen device detected, select level buttons show extra cube for consistency  
        cube.style.display = 'block';
        cube++ 
        }
    } else {
    //starting speed pc|
    speed = 3000; //<-Starting speed, with pointing devices
}

Starting Target count 
        if ('ontouchstart' in window) {
            objectCount = 4; //<-If Touchscreen device detected start with four targets  everything else, will change dynamically
        } else {
            objectCount = 3; //Else start with 3
        }
        startTheGame();
```
***
- Lives Remaining
    - Based on capture and click events, all Unsuccessful clicks and missed on-time events will disable one life element.
    - Based on the Score counter, every 50 score points will create one life. Enable one life element (if statement)
```JavaScript
//Set this to adjust How many points will add one life, This number must divide evenly with 100
pointsForLife = 50;
```
***
- Random Number generator
    - Extract Window height and width.
    - Create random number integer of a current window width and height.
```JavaScript
// get random position depending on screen size 
function posotioning() {
    w = gameWindowElement.offsetWidth;
    h = gameWindowElement.offsetHeight;
    x = Math.floor(Math.random() * (w - 50)) + 'px';
    y = Math.floor(Math.random() * (h - 50)) + 'px';
}
```
***
- In game target objects
    - Target HTML div elements in the DOM for game box targets.
    - Two random generated integers used for position x and y coardinates to target css position properties for HTML div elements.
```JavaScript
// append color and position for individual targets 
function objects() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        randColor = colours[(Math.random() * colours.length) | 0]
        posotioning();
        targets[i].style.display = 'block';
        targets[i].style.left = x;
        targets[i].style.top = y;
        targets[i].style.backgroundColor = randColor;
    }
}
```
***
- Click event listeners and capture events.
    - Create event listeners for game targets that will record successful clicks and disable target once clicked. If not will take away one life
```JavaScript
//target event listeners + styling once clickeed display none is set
function targetSetup() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        livesDivElement.style.transition = ".6s";
        targets[i].addEventListener('click', clickEvent = () => {
            targets[i].style.display = 'none';
            scoreCount = score.innerText;
            livesLogic();
        })
    }
}

```
***
- Create an event listener for the game window to record unsuccessful clicks. 
```JavaScript
//Detects clicks in game area and counts as miss 
function gameWindow() {
    // Game window mousedown listener
    gameWindowElement.addEventListener('mousedown', detectWindowEvents);
    function detectWindowEvents(event) {
        //Prevent click event trigger on child elements.                                    
        if (this === event.target) {
            clicks = 0;
            streak2 = 0;
            streak1 = 0;
            livesCount--;
            scoreMissed.innerText++;
            countDifference();
            deductLife()
            livesDivElement.style.width = '0';
            this.style.backgroundColor = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2)';
        };
    };

    gameWindowElement.addEventListener('mouseup', function () {
        this.style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
    });
}

```
***
- Capture events on all failed click attempts. I managed to achieve this by counting how many objects at the end of setInterval() cycle has display: none; 
```JavaScript
//Timing for target check if display none count is less than initial target count then it will be, sent to not click() function, for calculation
let notClick = 0;
function timigFunction() {
    
    notClick = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < targets.length; i++)
        if (targets[i].style.display === 'block') {
            notClick++;
        }
    if (notClick >= 3 && objectCount >= 3) {
        stopTheGame();
    } else if (notClick == 2 || notClick == 1) {
        livesCount = livesCount - notClick;
        deductLife()
    }
    console.log(livesCount)
    notClick = 0;
}

// Deduct life/lives if missed target/s
function deductLife() {
    if (livesCount == 2) {
        lives[0].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
    } else if (livesCount == 1) {
        lives[0].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        lives[1].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
    } else if (livesCount <= 0) {
        lives[0].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        lives[1].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        lives[2].style.backgroundColor = 'oldlace';
        stopTheGame();
    }
}
```
***
- Game setup
    - Based on Level selection. if "EASY", else if "MEDIUM", else if "HARD".
    - Level variable will be passed into the setInterval() function and will launch the game.
```JavaScript
// The game setup adds listeners and so on
function startTheGame() { 
    startGameElement.style.display = 'none';
    livesDivElement.style.width = '100%';
    levelsElement.style.display = 'none';
    gameWindow();
    targetSetup();
    levelH(speed);
}

function levelH(speed) {
    timer1 = setInterval(timingF, speed);//<-This set interval method Timing for game loop is' set dynamically 
    function timingF() { //<-The game set interval loop function.
        objects(); //<-Targets
        setTimeout(timigFunction, timing, ); //<-The timeout method to check the remaining target's timing is just at the end of the set interval time.
    }
}
```
- Game Progression levels
    - Speed will increase over, course of the game. 
    - Target count will increase over, course of the game.
    - Create setInterval() function passing, it into game level selection once desired score is, reached.
```JavaScript
//Set this to increase progression speed add targets as you like here
// points needed for progression
let progressPoints = 200;
//Speed progression multiplier
// adds an object on progression
function gameProgress() {
    if (progressPoints == score.innerText && objectCount <= 12) {
        progressPoints = progressPoints + speedScore;
        speed = speed - 200;
        timing = speed - 100;
        objectCount++; //< adds one target once every point is set for progression
        let listen = objectCount - 1;
        setTimeout(() => {
            targets[listen].addEventListener('click', addClickEvent = () => {
                targets[listen].style.display = 'none';
                scoreCount = score.innerText;
                livesLogic();
            });
        }, 20);
    }
}
```

- [W3C Markup Validator](project_files/validation/Html-Checker.PNG)
- [W3C CSS Validator](project_files/validation/W3C-CSS.PNG)
### **Future Testing**
I have tested the game on a variety of browsers such as  Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox desktop version browsers and Huawei p30 Pro chrome and android browser.

I have used Chrome DevTools to Test a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhone X for responsive design.

Friends and family members helped point out any bugs or issues.
### **User Stories Testing**
1. Information presented to understand the game rules is clear and easy to understand.
1. The game controls are clear and easy to use..
1. The game design is visually appealing and is user friendly.
1. To be able to select different levels depending on player skill level is great.
1. That the Game is available on mobile devices and or  pc's  is essential.
1. Bug report form is easy to understand and easy to use.
1. I have been advised to add more in-game variations, such as target timings.
### **Solved issues or bugs**
1. After adding a click event listener to the game window, all the children elements within the parent element were triggered.

    `Solution i wound on her https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1369035/how-do-i-prevent-a-parents-onclick-event-from-firing-when-a-child-anchor-is-cli `
```javascript
    if (this === event.target) {
    }
```
***
2. Friends and family members pointed out that the game on Mobile devices was too slow.
     
     `To solve this, I have added touch device detection and for mobile devices I have added extra target and faster initial speed.`
```javascript
    if ('ontouchstart' in window) {
        speed = 2800;
        }
    } else {
        speed = 3000;
    }
```
***

3. After friends pointed out that it would be more interesting if in-game progression extra targets would spawn as you paly
     `To make this work, I had to redesign the target creation I used for-loop to create extra targets and for target listeners`
```javascript
// append color and position for individual targets 
function objects() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        randColor = colours[(Math.random() * colours.length) | 0]
        posotioning();
        targets[i].style.display = 'block';
        targets[i].style.left = x;
        targets[i].style.top = y;
        targets[i].style.backgroundColor = randColor;
    }
}

//target event listeners + styling
function targetSetup() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        livesDivElement.style.transition = ".6s";
        targets[i].addEventListener('click', clickEvent = () => {
            targets[i].style.display = 'none';
            scoreCount = score.innerText;
            livesLogic();
        })
    }
}

//Add target event listeners to the targets
function addTargetListeners() {
    for (let i = 0; i < objectCount; i++) {
        targets[i].addEventListener('click', clickEvent = () => {});
    }
}
//Speed progression multiplier
// adds an target if target points reached on progression
 function gameProgress() {
    if (progressPoints == score.innerText && objectCount <= 12) {
        progressPoints = progressPoints + speedScore;
        speed = speed - 200;
        timing = speed - 100;
        objectCount++;
        let listen = objectCount - 1;
        setTimeout(() => {
            targets[listen].addEventListener('click', addClickEvent = () => {
                targets[listen].style.display = 'none';
                scoreCount = score.innerText;
                livesLogic();
            });
        }, 20);
    }
}
```
***

4. In landscape mode on mobile devices, some of elements were pushed out of the size of the screen.

    `I have solved this by disabling some of the elements using Media query is a CSS technique.`
```css
@media only screen and (max-height: 530px) {
    .elements {
        display: none
    }
}
```
***
5.  The issue with the progress bar no resetting in some cases and missed points not counting'

  `Added missed score counter++ to the loop to count missed points and added to deduct Life function resset to 0`
```javascript

// added to timing function missed score counter++ to the loop
            scoreMissed.innerText++;
            scoreMissed.innerText + livesCount;
// added to deduct Life function
              streak2 = 0;
              streak1 = 0;
            livesDivElement.style.width = '0';
```
